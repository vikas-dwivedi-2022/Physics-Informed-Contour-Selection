# Physics Informed Contour Selection (PICS)
Effective training of deep image segmentation models is challenging due to the need for abundant, high-quality annotations.
To facilitate image annotation, we introduce Physics Informed Contour Selection (PICS) - an interpretable, physics-informed
algorithm for rapid image segmentation without relying on labeled data. PICS draws inspiration from physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs) and an active contour model called snake. It is fast and computationally lightweight because it employs cubic
splines instead of a deep neural network as a basis function. Its training parameters are physically interpretable because they
directly represent control knots of the segmentation curve. Traditional snakes involve minimization of the edge-based loss
functionals by deriving the Euler-Lagrange equation followed by its numerical solution. However, PICS directly minimizes the
loss functional, bypassing the Euler Lagrange equations. It is the first snake variant to minimize a region-based loss function
instead of traditional edge-based loss functions. PICS uniquely models the three-dimensional (3D) segmentation process with
an unsteady partial differential equation (PDE), which allows accelerated segmentation via transfer learning. To demonstrate
its effectiveness, we apply PICS for 3D segmentation of the left ventricle on a publicly available cardiac dataset. We also
demonstrate PICSâ€™s capacity to encode the prior shape information as a loss term by proposing a new convexity-preserving loss
term for left ventricle. Overall, PICS presents several novelties in network architecture, transfer learning, and physics-inspired
losses for image segmentation, thereby showing promising outcomes and potential for further refinement.
