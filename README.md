# Physics Informed Contour Selection for Rapid Image Segmentation
PICS combines the best of Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and an active contour model called Snake to help human experts create 3D image segmentations rapidly. The link of the paper is: . The current repository contain representative MATLAB codes to understand the methodology in the original paper. Please keep in mind that PICS is still under development (effect of number of control knots, position of initialization, etc has not been studied) and could be improved further (inverse parameter estimation).
